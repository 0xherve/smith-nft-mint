# Smith Collection NFT Mint

This is a repository for creating the `Red Hammer NFT`.


## Project Layout

The NFT mint script is in the `index.ts` file.

The Metadata Object is implemented in the `metadata.ts` file. 

The code was written following the `How to Create a Core Asset with Javascript` guide in the Metaplex Core documentation.

The NFT is minted with the `ts-node index.ts` command.


## Lessons

There are 3 major challenges regarding the trading of minted NFTs, namely:

1. In order to sell the minted NFTs, I need to contact people and inquire about their interest in buying them.

2. As I want to buy different Collectibles, I have to reach out to other people and ask if they have NFTs for me to buy.

3. The trading of NFTs is done with no guarantee that the other party will honor their end of the bargain.


## Solution: P2P Marketplace Platform 

I would propose a Peer-to-Peer platform for people to list NFTs at their desired price of exchange.

### Core Features

1. **NFT Listing**: Allowing sellers to have a single place to showcase their NFTs and attract buyers. 
2. **Discovery**: Sellers can find buyers easily, and buyers are able to find multiple sellers for collectibles.
3. **Instant Transaction after payment**: Automated escrow that holds the listed NFT and sends it to the buyer when the payment is confirmed, allowing for trustless online asset trades.
